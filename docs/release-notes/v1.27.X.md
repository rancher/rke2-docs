## Release [v1.27.16+rke2r1](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.27.16+rke2r1)
<!-- v1.27.16+rke2r1 -->

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.27.16.

**Important Note**

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
```bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
```

## Release [v1.27.13+rke2r1](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.27.13+rke2r1)
<!-- v1.27.13+rke2r1 -->

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.27.13.

**Important Note**

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
```bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
```

## Release [v1.27.12+rke2r1](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.27.12+rke2r1)
<!-- v1.27.12+rke2r1 -->

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.27.12.

:::warning Important Notes


Canal uses flannel 0.24.3 which includes a bug: every 5 seconds it tries to add ipv6 iptables rules and fails if the node does not have an ipv6 address. The consequence is the log "Failed to ensure iptables rules: error setting up rules: failed to apply partial iptables-restore unable to run iptables-restore (, ): exit status 4" appears every 5 seconds in the flannel container of the canal pod.

Flannel daemonset is not tolerating node taints: "node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd:NoExecute", "node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule" and "node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized:NoSchedule" which can create problems when deploying with Rancher in certain cloud-providers (e.g. vShpere or DigitalOcean).

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
```bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
```

:::warning Important Notes


Addresses the runc CVE: [CVE-2024-21626](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21626) by updating runc to v1.1.12.

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup.

## Release [v1.27.9+rke2r1](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.27.9+rke2r1)
<!-- v1.27.9+rke2r1 -->

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.27.9.

**Important Note**

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
```bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
```

### Changes since v1.27.8+rke2r1:

* Bump containerd and runc [(#5120)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/5120)
  * Bumped containerd/runc to v1.7.10/v1.1.10
* Bump containerd to v1.7.11 [(#5130)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/5130)
* Update to 1.27.9 for december 2023 [(#5151)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/5151)

## Release [v1.27.4+rke2r1](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.27.4+rke2r1)
<!-- v1.27.4+rke2r1 -->

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.27.4, and fixes a number of issues.

**Important Note**

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
```bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
```

## Release [v1.27.2+rke2r1](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.27.2+rke2r1)
<!-- v1.27.2+rke2r1 -->

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.27.2, and fixes a number of issues.

:::warning Important Notes


1. If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
```bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
```

2. Many systems have updated their packages with newer version of container-selinux (> v2.191.0) which is incompatible with our rke2-selinux policy and require a change in policy. We have updated our policy; you will notice the rke2-selinux package being upgraded from version v0.11.1 to newer version v0.12.0.
