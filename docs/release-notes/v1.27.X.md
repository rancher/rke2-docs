## Release v1.27.6+rke2r1
<!-- v1.27.6+rke2r1 -->

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.27.5.

**Important Note**

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
```bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
```

### Changes since v1.27.5+rke2r1:

* Update cilium to 1.14.1 [(#4756)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/4756)
* Update Kubernetes to v1.27.6 [(#4761)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/4761)

See https://github.com/rancher/rke2/security/advisories/GHSA-p45j-vfv5-wprq for more information, including mandatory steps necessary to harden clusters against this vulnerability.

## Release v1.27.2+rke2r1
<!-- v1.27.2+rke2r1 -->

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.27.2, and fixes a number of issues.

**Important Notes**

1. If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
```bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
```

2. Many systems have updated their packages with newer version of container-selinux (> v2.191.0) which is incompatible with our rke2-selinux policy and require a change in policy. We have updated our policy; you will notice the rke2-selinux package being upgraded from version v0.11.1 to newer version v0.12.0.

## Release v1.27.1+rke2r1
<!-- v1.27.1+rke2r1 -->

This release is RKE2's first in the v1.27 line. This release updates Kubernetes to v1.27.1.

Before upgrading from earlier releases, be sure to read the Kubernetes [Urgent Upgrade Notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md#urgent-upgrade-notes).

**Important Note**

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
```bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
```

### Changes since v1.26.4+rke2r1:
* Bump to kubernetes v1.27.1 ([#4108](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/4108))
