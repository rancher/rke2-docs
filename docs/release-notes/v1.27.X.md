## Release [v1.27.9+rke2r1](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.27.9+rke2r1)
<!-- v1.27.9+rke2r1 -->

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.27.9.

**Important Note**

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
```bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
```

### Changes since v1.27.8+rke2r1:

* Bump containerd and runc [(#5120)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/5120)
  * Bumped containerd/runc to v1.7.10/v1.1.10
* Bump containerd to v1.7.11 [(#5130)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/5130)
* Update to 1.27.9 for december 2023 [(#5151)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/5151)

## Release [v1.27.8+rke2r1](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.27.8+rke2r1)
<!-- v1.27.8+rke2r1 -->

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.27.8.

**Important Notes**

This release includes a version of ingress-nginx affected by [CVE-2023-5043](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/10571) and [CVE-2023-5044](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/10572). Ingress administrators should set the --enable-annotation-validation flag to enforce restrictions on the contents of ingress-nginx annotation fields.

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
```bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
```

## Release [v1.27.2+rke2r1](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.27.2+rke2r1)
<!-- v1.27.2+rke2r1 -->

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.27.2, and fixes a number of issues.

**Important Notes**

1. If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
```bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
```

2. Many systems have updated their packages with newer version of container-selinux (> v2.191.0) which is incompatible with our rke2-selinux policy and require a change in policy. We have updated our policy; you will notice the rke2-selinux package being upgraded from version v0.11.1 to newer version v0.12.0.
