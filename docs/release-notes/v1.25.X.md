## Release [v1.25.16+rke2r1](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.25.16+rke2r1)
<!-- v1.25.16+rke2r1 -->

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.25.16.

**Important Notes**

This release includes a version of ingress-nginx affected by [CVE-2023-5043](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/10571) and [CVE-2023-5044](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/10572). Ingress administrators should set the --enable-annotation-validation flag to enforce restrictions on the contents of ingress-nginx annotation fields.

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
```bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
```

### Changes since v1.25.6+rke2r1:

  * Fixed an issue where leader-elected controllers for managed etcd did not run on etcd-only nodes
  * RKE2 now functions properly when the cluster CA certificates are signed by an existing root or intermediate CA. You can find a sample script for generating such certificates before RKE2 starts in the K3s repo at [contrib/util/certs.sh](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/blob/master/contrib/util/generate-custom-ca-certs.sh).
  * RKE2 now supports `kubeadm` style join tokens. `rke2 token create` now creates join token secrets, optionally with a limited TTL.
  * RKE2 agents joined with an expired or deleted token stay in the cluster using existing client certificates via the NodeAuthorization admission plugin, unless their Node object is deleted from the cluster.
  * ServiceLB now honors the Service's ExternalTrafficPolicy. When set to Local, the LoadBalancer will only advertise addresses of Nodes with a Pod for the Service, and will not forward traffic to other cluster members. (ServiceLB is still disabled by default)
* Bump K3s commit [(#3906)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3906)
* Add bootstrap token auth handler [(#3921)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3921)
* Bump helm-controller/klipper-helm [(#3937)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3937)
  * The embedded helm-controller job image now correctly handles upgrading charts that contain resource types that no longer exist on the target Kubernetes version. This includes properly handling removal of PodSecurityPolicy resources when upgrading from &lt;= v1.24.
* Add sig-storage snapshot controller and validation webhook [(#3943)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3943)
* Add a quick host-path CSI snapshot to the basic CI test [(#3947)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3947)
* Update kubernetes to v1.25.7 [(#3952)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3952)

## Release [v1.25.6+rke2r1](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.25.6+rke2r1)
<!-- v1.25.6+rke2r1 -->

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.25.6 to backport registry changes and fix two critical issues.

**Important Note**

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:

<!-- v1.25.5+rke2r2 -->

This release updates containerd to v1.6.14 to resolve an issue where pods would lose their CNI information when containerd was restarted.

**Important Note**

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:

### Changes since v1.25.5+rke2r1:

* Bump containerd to v1.6.14-k3s1 [(#3746)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3746)
  * The embedded containerd version has been bumped to v1.6.14-k3s1. This includes a backported fix for [containerd/7843](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/7843) which caused pods to lose their CNI info when containerd was restarted, which in turn caused the kubelet to recreate the pod. 
  * Windows agents now use the k3s fork of containerd, which includes support for registry rewrites.

> ## ⚠️ WARNING

## Release [v1.25.3+rke2r1](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.25.3+rke2r1)
<!-- v1.25.3+rke2r1 -->

This release update Kubernetes to v1.25.3+rke2r1, fixes a number of minor issues, and includes security updates.

**Important Note**

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
```bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
```

## Release [v1.25.0+rke2r1](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/tag/v1.25.0+rke2r1)
<!-- v1.25.0+rke2r1 -->

This release is RKE2's first in the v1.25 line. This release updates Kubernetes to v1.25.0.

Before upgrading from earlier releases, be sure to read the Kubernetes [Urgent Upgrade Notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md#urgent-upgrade-notes).

**Important Notes**

1. If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

    You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
    ```bash
    cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
    ```

2. Kubernetes v1.25 removes the beta `PodSecurityPolicy` admission plugin. Please follow the [upstream documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/migrate-from-psp/) to migrate from PSP if using the built-in PodSecurity Admission Plugin, prior to upgrading to v1.25.0+rke2r1.

3. RKE2 now supports version 1.23 of the CIS Benchmark for Kubernetes. The legacy CIS 1.5 and 1.6 profiles (`profile: cis-1.5` and `profile: cis-1.6`) have been removed as they do not apply to Kubernetes 1.25. Servers using one of the legacy profiles must be updated to specify the `cis-1.23` profile when upgrading to RKE2 1.25, or RKE2 will fail to start.

### Changes since v1.24.4+rke2r1:

* Update Cilium version and remove startup-script [(#3274)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3274)
