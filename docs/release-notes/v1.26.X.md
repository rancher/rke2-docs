## Release v1.26.9+rke2r1
<!-- v1.26.9+rke2r1 -->

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.26.9.

**Important Note**

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
```bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
```

### Changes since v1.26.8+rke2r1:

* Update cilium to 1.14.1 [(#4757)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/4757)
* Update Kubernetes to v1.26.9 [(#4762)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/4762)

## Release v1.26.8+rke2r1
<!-- v1.26.8+rke2r1 -->

**Important Notes**

* ⚠️ This release includes support for remediating CVE-2023-32186, a potential Denial of Service attack vector on RKE2 servers. See https://github.com/rancher/rke2/security/advisories/GHSA-p45j-vfv5-wprq for more information, including mandatory steps necessary to harden clusters against this vulnerability.

* If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

  You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:

## Release v1.26.6+rke2r1
<!-- v1.26.6+rke2r1 -->

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.26.6, and fixes a number of issues.

**Important Note**

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
```bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
```

### Changes since v1.26.5+rke2r1:

* Update canal chart [(#4343)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/4343)
* Bump K3s version for v1.26 [(#4358)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/4358)

## Release v1.26.2+rke2r1
<!-- v1.26.2+rke2r1 -->

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.26.2, and fixes a number of issues.

**Important Note**

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore.

### Changes since v1.26.1+rke2r1:

* Remove pod logs as part of killall [(#3821)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3821)
* Update channel server [(#3853)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3853)
* Bump cilium images [(#3802)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3802)

* Bump K3s version [(#3897)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3897)
  * Fixed an issue where leader-elected controllers for managed etcd did not run on etcd-only nodes
  * RKE2 now functions properly when the cluster CA certificates are signed by an existing root or intermediate CA. You can find a sample script for generating such certificates before RKE2 starts in the K3s repo at [contrib/util/certs.sh](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/blob/master/contrib/util/certs.sh).
  * RKE2 now supports `kubeadm` style join tokens. `rke2 token create` now creates join token secrets, optionally with a limited TTL.
  * RKE2 agents joined with an expired or deleted token stay in the cluster using existing client certificates via the NodeAuthorization admission plugin, unless their Node object is deleted from the cluster.
  * ServiceLB now honors the Service's ExternalTrafficPolicy. When set to Local, the LoadBalancer will only advertise addresses of Nodes with a Pod for the Service, and will not forward traffic to other cluster members. (ServiceLB is still disabled by default)
* Bump K3s commit [(#3905)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3905)
* Add bootstrap token auth handler [(#3920)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3920)

  * The embedded helm-controller job image now correctly handles upgrading charts that contain resource types that no longer exist on the target Kubernetes version. This includes properly handling removal of PodSecurityPolicy resources when upgrading from <= v1.24.
* Add sig-storage snapshot controller and validation webhook [(#3944)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3944)
* Add a quick host-path CSI snapshot to the basic CI test [(#3946)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3946)
* Update kubernetes to v1.26.2 [(#3953)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3953)

## Release v1.26.1+rke2r1
<!-- v1.26.1+rke2r1 -->

This release updates Kubernetes to v1.26.1 to backport registry changes and fix two critical issues.

**Important Note**

If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the `--token` CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster:
```bash
cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token
```

## Release v1.26.0+rke2r2
<!-- v1.26.0+rke2r2 -->

This release updates containerd to v1.6.14 to resolve an issue where pods would lose their CNI information when containerd was restarted.

### Changes since v1.26.0+rke2r1:

* Bump containerd to v1.6.14-k3s1 [(#3746)](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/pull/3746)
  * The embedded containerd version has been bumped to v1.6.14-k3s1. This includes a backported fix for [containerd/7843](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/7843) which caused pods to lose their CNI info when containerd was restarted, which in turn caused the kubelet to recreate the pod. 
  * Windows agents now use the k3s fork of containerd, which includes support for registry rewrites.

## Release v1.26.0+rke2r1
<!-- v1.26.0+rke2r1 -->

> ## ⚠️ WARNING
> This release is affected by https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/7843, which causes the kubelet to restart all pods whenever RKE2 is restarted. For this reason, we have removed this RKE2 release from the channel server. Please use `v1.26.0+rke2r2` instead.

This release is RKE2's first in the v1.26 line. This release updates Kubernetes to v1.26.0.
