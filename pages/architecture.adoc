= Anatomy of a Next Generation Kubernetes Distribution

== Architecture Overview

With RKE2 we take lessons learned from developing and maintaining our lightweight https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes]
distribution, https://k3s.io[K3s], and apply them to build an enterprise-ready distribution with https://k3s.io[K3s] ease-of-use.
What this means is that RKE2 is, at its simplest, a single binary to be installed and configured on all nodes expected
to participate in the https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes] cluster. Once started, RKE2 is then able to bootstrap and supervise
role-appropriate agents per node while sourcing needed content from the network.

RKE2 brings together a number of Open Source technologies to make this all work:

* https://k3s.io[K3s]
 ** https://github.com/k3s-io/helm-controller[Helm Controller]
* https://kubernetes.io[K8s]
 ** https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cmd/kube-apiserver[API Server]
 ** https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cmd/kube-controller-manager[Controller Manager]
 ** https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cmd/kubelet[Kubelet]
 ** https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cmd/kube-scheduler[Scheduler]
 ** https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cmd/kube-proxy[Proxy]
* https://etcd.io[etcd]
* https://github.com/opencontainers/runc[runc]
* https://containerd.io[containerd]/https://github.com/kubernetes/cri-api[cri]
* https://github.com/containernetworking/cni[CNI]: Canal (https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/about[Calico] & https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel[Flannel]), https://cilium.io[Cilium], https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/about[Calico] or https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel[Flannel]. Additionally: https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni[Multus]
* https://coredns.io[CoreDNS]
* https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx[Ingress NGINX Controller] and/or https://traefik.io/traefik[Traefik]
* https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server[Metrics Server]
* https://helm.sh[Helm]

All of these, except Traefik, are compiled and statically linked with https://github.com/golang/go/tree/dev.boringcrypto/misc/boring[Go+BoringCrypto].

== Process Lifecycle

=== Content Bootstrap

RKE2 sources binaries and manifests to run both _server_ and _agent_ nodes from the RKE2 Runtime image.
This means RKE2 scans `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/images/*.tar` for the https://hub.docker.com/r/rancher/rke2-runtime/tags[`rancher/rke2-runtime`]
image (with a tag correlating to the output of `rke2 --version`) by default and if it cannot be found, attempts to pull
it from the network (a.k.a. Docker Hub). RKE2 then extracts `/bin/` from the image, flattening it into
`+/var/lib/rancher/rke2/data/${RKE2_DATA_KEY}/bin+` where `+${RKE2_DATA_KEY}+` represents a unique string identifying the
image.

For RKE2 to work as expected the runtime image must minimally provide:

* *`containerd`* (the https://github.com/kubernetes/cri-api[CRI])
* *`containerd-shim`* (shims wrap `runc` tasks and do not stop when `containerd` does)
* *`containerd-shim-runc-v1`*
* *`containerd-shim-runc-v2`*
* *`kubelet`* (the Kubernetes node agent)
* *`runc`* (the OCI runtime)

The following ops tooling is also provided by the runtime image:

* *`ctr`* (low level `containerd` maintenance and inspection)
* *`crictl`* (low level CRI maintenance and inspection)
* *`kubectl`* (kubernetes cluster maintenance and inspection)
* *`socat`* (needed by `containerd` for port-forwarding)

After the binaries have been extracted RKE2 will then extract charts from the image
into the `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests` directory.

=== Initialize Server

In the embedded K3s engine servers are specialized agent processes which means that the following startup will be
deferred until the node container runtime has started.

==== Prepare Components

===== `kube-apiserver`

Pull the `kube-apiserver` image, if not present already, and spin up a goroutine to wait for `etcd`
and then write the static pod definition in `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/pod-manifests/`.

===== `kube-controller-manager`

Pull the `kube-controller-manager` image, if not present already, and spin up a goroutine to wait for `kube-apiserver`
and then write the static pod definition in `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/pod-manifests/`.

===== `kube-scheduler`

Pull the `kube-scheduler` image, if not present already, and spin up a goroutine to wait for `kube-apiserver`
and then write the static pod definition in `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/pod-manifests/`.

==== Start Cluster

Spin up an HTTP server in a goroutine to listen for other cluster servers/agents then initialize/join the cluster.

===== `etcd`

Pull the `etcd` image, if not present already, and spin up a goroutine to wait for the `kubelet`
and then write the static pod definition in `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/pod-manifests/`.

===== `helm-controller`

Spin up the goroutine to start the embedded `helm-controller` after waiting for `kube-apiserver` to be ready.

=== Initialize Agent

The agent process entry point. For server processes the embedded K3s engine invokes this directly.

==== Container Runtime

===== `containerd`

Spawn the `containerd` process and listen for termination. If `containerd` exits then the `rke2` process will also exit.

==== Node Agent

===== `kubelet`

Spawn and supervise the `kubelet` process. If `kubelet` exits then `rke2` will attempt to restart it.
Once the `kubelet` is running it will start any available static pods. For servers this means that `etcd`
and `kube-apiserver` will start, in succession, allowing the remaining components started via static pod
to connect to the `kube-apiserver` and begin their processing.

==== Server Charts

On server nodes, the `helm-controller` can now apply to the cluster any charts found in `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests`.

* rke2-canal.yaml or rke2-cilium.yaml or rke2-calico.yaml or rke2-flannel.yaml or rke2-multus.yaml (daemonset, bootstrap)
* rke2-coredns.yaml (deployment, bootstrap)
* rke2-ingress-nginx.yaml and/or rke2-traefik.yaml and rke2-traefik-crd.yaml (deployment)
* rke2-metrics-server.yaml (deployment)
* rke2-runtimeclasses.yaml (deployment)
* rke2-snapshot-controller-crd.yaml, rke2-snapshot-controller.yaml and rke2-snapshot-validation-webhook.yaml (deployment)

=== Daemon Process

The RKE2 process will now run indefinitely until it receives a SIGTERM or SIGKILL or if the `containerd` process exits.
